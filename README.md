# Xenoblade Google Doodle

On June 10 2010, a company by the name of Monolith Soft released a JRPG titled Xenoblade Chronicles to the Nintendo Wii. Originially the game was only available in Japan, but after thousands of handwritten letters from fans begging for an English version dubbed Project Rainfall, the game was finally given the spotlight it deserved: a full European locallization, released in 2011 and later in America in 2012.

The game follows a young research scientist named Shulk, who uses the knowledge he discovers to fight back against a relentless robotic army known as the Mechon. He, along with his childhood friends and some more that he meets along the way, set off on a journey to avenge his hometown and put an end to the fighting once and for all.

This year marks the 11th anniversary of the gameâ€™s release, and the 10th anniversary of the success of Project Rainfall and the European localization. Such an impactful game deserves all the recognition it can get, and, with its recent HD remaster for the Nintendo Switch, to be experienced and enjoyed by generations to come.
